SYSMA is an Assistant which calculates RAM and CPU usage in 
background.
It has decent UI with voice assistant
<br>

**it does not take voice inputs**<br>
**no input is required for its operation**<br>

to control its behaviour you will need to open the console
and there are commands for changing its behaviour
<br>to run the code type this in command prompt
<br>

`python SYSMA_UI.py`<br>
this will run the main script

_to run the background script use:_
`python SYSMA_BG.py`

running `SYSMA_UI.py` automatically runs `SYSMA_BG.py
